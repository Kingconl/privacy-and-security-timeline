# Privacy and Security Timeline

This is a timeline of events relevant to privacy and security, primarily those taking place during the Winter 2026 COMP2109 course at Carleton University.

## Contributing

Have an event you think belongs on the timeline? Please contribute!

You can either fork the repo, make your changes to the [timeline.json](src/data/timeline.json) file, and open a pull request, or simply open an issue and provide the details of the event.

As a bonus, feel free to contribute to the design of the website by forking, making your changes, and opening a pull request! We're in a privacy and security course, so be mindful of those who wish to disable JavaScript in their browsers. Try challenging yourself by ensuring that any JavaScript you add is limited to the code executed at build-time by Astro. Oh! And check out the Astro documentation at [docs.astro.build](https://docs.astro.build/en/).

### How do I open an issue?

- Create a GitHub account if you do not already have one
- Click the "Issues" tab near the top of this page
- Click the "New Issue" button on the right side of the page (it should be the bright green one!)
